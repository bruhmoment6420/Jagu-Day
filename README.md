# Jagu-Day
The ultimate guide for Jagu-Day. The app comes prebuilt with the most prestigious of jagu spamzz and impressive features such as in-app wishing.
## Using the App
Now since im broke I cant realy afford publishing my app on a store. So use the following methonds instead to run the app:
### Installing the APK:
I've included a APK file in the [releases](https://github.com/bruhmoment6420/Jagu-Day/releases/tag/v1.0) section. Sadly this will only work for Android devices. To run it in a IOS device follow the next method.
### Using Expo Go:
I used the Expo Wrapper to write this app. So you can use the Expo GO app to run the app. You can find all the info [here.](https://expo.io/@tahlial/projects/jaguar-day)
### Setting Up a Development:

#### Step 1:

#### Step 3:
